## My process

- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

 - I Learned Bootstrap v5.0. 
 - I learn how to add custom CSS to bootstrap to change look according to the requirement. 

### Useful resources

- [Documentation of Bootstrap v5.0](https://www.example.com) - It helps to find out how to implement a specific thing in bootstrap. I think this is all required and need to learn bootstrap!
